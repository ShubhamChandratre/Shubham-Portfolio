# Shubham Chandratre - Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built using **React.js**. It highlights my skills, projects, and experience in the tech field. Below are the instructions to run this project locally and the tools I used to develop it.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js
  - JavaScript (ES6)
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - Bootstrap (for responsive design)

- **Version Control**:
  - Git
  - GitHub

- **Others**:
  - VS Code (IDE)
  - Node.js (for running React development server)

## 🚀 Running the Project Locally

To run the portfolio website on your local machine, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShubhamChandratre/Shubham-Portfolio.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies using **npm**:
